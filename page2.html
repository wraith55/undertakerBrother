		The Undertaker’s demolition of established wrestlers made him a target for newcomers, such as
			Mankind and Goldust, looking to make a name for themselves. The Undertaker dispatched each
			of these would-be challengers to the Dead Man’s throne. It wasn’t until the Undertaker’s dark
			past returned to haunt him in the form of his brother Kane that a true threat to the Phenom’s
			legacy arose.
