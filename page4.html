			him alive, never to be heard from again. That which is dead can never die, though, and the
			Undertaker returned from the grave to defeat his brother at Wrestlemania 20. Undertaker
			continued his path of destruction, carving through newer superstars such as CM Punk, Edge, and
			Batista on his path to reclaiming his former glory.</main>
