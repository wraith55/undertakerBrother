		<h3>After defeating (and eventually allying with) his brother, The Undertaker embraced his more
			human side. While the mysterious aura of the Undertaker was no longer filled the arena, his
			viciousness was still clearly evident. During this period in his career, Undertaker fought against
			some of his most vicious opponents, including a brutal Hell in a Cell match against Brock
			Lesnar.</h3>
