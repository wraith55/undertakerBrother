		<main class= "main">In 1990, the Undertaker debuted at the Survivor Series pay-per- view show, as the mystery
			partner for the Million Dollar Man’s “Million Dollar Team.” The Undertaker, standing nearly 7
			feet tall and over 300 pounds, was immediately a force to be reckoned with. He soon began
			feuding with the World Wrestling Federations top superstars, such as the Ultimate Warrior,
			Yokozuna, and most notably, Hulk Hogan, whom he defeated for his first world heavyweight
			title, just one year after his initial debut.</main>
